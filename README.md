# Text generator

This is a simple text generator that uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

## How do I run this?

Simply install all dependencies using `npm i -y`, then you can use a few specific commands from the CLI.

If you want to check this out on your local environment, use `npm run start` - this will initialise a locally hosted web server.

If you want to see that the tests really did pass, use `npx jest` or `npm test` - both will run Jest.
